<h1> Jiujitsu! </h1>
<h3> What is it, and why do i like it? </h3>
	<p> Jiujitsu is a japanese system of unarmed and undarmoured defence that can be used to defend one's self. Personally, i adore the sport for its
	more competitive side, and thew satisfaction of learning new techniques. </p>
<hr/>
<h3> Brief history </h3>
<p> The creation of Jiu-Jitsu began around 700AD, when japanese professors combined other martial arts with sumo for use on the battlefield. This
 proved to be highly succesful and because of this, the japanese continued to use it for hundreds of years. </p>

 <h3> My experience </h3>
	<p> I started jiujitsu when I was around 15, and originally I was not exactly keen on trying it. I had done judo for around 9 years at this 
	point, and it was actually my jiujitsu teacher who encouranged me to try it out. However, I found myself loving the sport more and more by the 
	day. Before i knew it, i was going 5-6 times a week, and entering competitions, including the worlds, which I plan to attend (and maybe win) 
	this July! </p>

	<p> A good place to start jiujitsu is with a friend, either someone you already know or another person who wants to start! If you want to learn 
	more about the sport, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu">here</a> is a good link! Additionally, you can ask me at
