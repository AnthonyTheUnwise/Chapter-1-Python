<h2> Our History </h2>
<h3> Our Original founder </h3>
	<p> 
	Our company was originally founded by the great Johnson McDonaldson, whom had a crazy idea to provide cheap and affordable
	home control units to as many families in need, and to do so efficently across the country. Because of him, we now have Johnson McJohnson's
	screens!
	</p>

<h3> Brief history on the company </h3>
	<p> 
	We were initially a small rural company, working on perfecting our craft and lowering costs of production in 1938. We had our first big company 
	change in 1958, with the discovery of high-tech fibreglass screens, and in 2009 another massive breakthrough with secure installation processes.
